# `winter service` — service orchestration

For the hub and the rest of the command surface, see [../index.md](../index.md).

```bash

winter service down alpha                             # stop them
winter service status                                 # report all services in all envs (patterns optional)
winter service status alpha                           # all services in alpha (expands to alpha/*)
winter service status alpha/api                       # one specific service

```

`winter service` owns a stable `up`/`down`/`status`/`restart`/`logs` interface and dispatches each invocation to whichever orchestrator the workspace registers. Consumers depend on `winter service …` and never on the orchestrator's implementation, so a workspace can swap tmux for containers or a supervising daemon without re-teaching agents, docs, or habits.

`status`, `restart`, and `logs` use **segment-aware glob PATTERNS** over `<env>/<service>` — the same vocabulary `winter ws` uses for `<env>/<repo>` (see [ws/patterns.md](./ws/patterns.md)). Within each segment, `*`, `?`, and `[...]` match as usual; `*` does not cross `/`. A bare `<env>` (no slash) expands to `<env>/*`. Multiple patterns can be passed in one invocation. Cross-environment selection is supported: `'*/backend'` selects the `backend` service across every env. `up` and `down` always operate on a whole env (no pattern syntax). For `restart` and `logs`, at least one pattern is required (action commands require an explicit target — no implicit "everything", mirroring `winter ws merge` requiring a source ref). For `status`, omitting all patterns selects every service in every env (read-shaped, defaults to all like `winter ws status`).

Registering an orchestrator uses the capability registry: `capabilities.service = "<name>"` in the `[capabilities]` table of `.winter/config.toml` names the extension, and `provides.service = "<path>"` in that extension's `[provides]` table in `winter-ext.toml` declares the entrypoint. When exactly one extension provides the slot, the `capabilities.service` binding is optional (implicit sole-provider). Two providers with no explicit binding is an ambiguity error. The legacy keys `service_orchestrator` (config) and `orchestrate_services` (manifest) are still accepted as **deprecated** aliases — config-load folds `service_orchestrator` into `capabilities.service`; `capability_entrypoint()` falls back to `orchestrate_services` when `provides.service` is absent. See [setup.md#capability-registry](../setup.md#capability-registry) for the full resolution model and [capabilities.md](./capabilities.md) to introspect the current binding.

## Local-path override

Use the `--service-orchestrator` root flag or the `WINTER_SERVICE_ORCHESTRATOR` environment variable to point `winter service` at a **local extension directory** for a single invocation — without changing `.winter/config.toml` or reinstalling anything. This is the primary way to test an in-progress orchestrator whose installed copy still lags the worktree:

```bash
# flag form (highest precedence)
winter --service-orchestrator=alpha/winter-service-tmux service up alpha

# env-var form
WINTER_SERVICE_ORCHESTRATOR=alpha/winter-service-tmux winter service status
```

**Precedence (highest wins):** `--service-orchestrator` flag → `WINTER_SERVICE_ORCHESTRATOR` env var → `service_orchestrator` in `.winter/config.toml`.

**Path-vs-name disambiguation:**
- If the value contains an OS path separator (`/` on POSIX) or resolves to an existing directory → **path mode**: reads `winter-ext.toml` from that directory directly, skipping the config-key-present and matches-an-installed-extension checks. The directory must still declare a `service` entrypoint (`provides.service`, or the legacy `orchestrate_services`) in its `winter-ext.toml`, and that entrypoint file must exist on disk.
- Otherwise (bare name like `winter-service-tmux`) → **name mode**: falls through to the normal registered-extension lookup, same as the config key.

**Doctor note:** `winter doctor` reflects the *installed* extension (not the override target), so during an override window, warnings about a lagging or mismatched installed extension are expected and can be ignored.

**Scope:** the override affects **dispatch only** — `WINTER_EXT_DIR`/`WINTER_EXT_PREFIX` are set from the resolved local directory, and the entrypoint is invoked from it. It does NOT affect `winter-service-tmux:` path-notation used in agent docs, nor `@`-loaded markdown references. The override is per-invocation only; it is not persisted.

**Typical use:** during orchestrator development, when the workspace's installed extension copy is behind your working branch:

```bash
# All four verbs work via the override:
winter --service-orchestrator=alpha/winter-service-tmux service up alpha
winter --service-orchestrator=alpha/winter-service-tmux service status
winter --service-orchestrator=alpha/winter-service-tmux service down alpha

# Control: without the override, the installed (lagging) copy is used — expect
# "declares no service entrypoint" or "not an installed extension" if it hasn't shipped yet.
winter service up alpha
```

## Orchestrator contract

This is the full spec a service-orchestrator extension is written against — conform to it without reading winter's source.

### Uniform invocation rule

winter invokes the entrypoint differently depending on the action:

```
<entrypoint> <action> <env>                   # up, down
<entrypoint> <action> [<pattern>...]          # status, restart, logs
```

`<action>` is one of `up`, `down`, `status`, `restart`, `logs`. For `up` and `down`, `<env>` is the feature-env name (`alpha`, `beta`, …). For `status`, `restart`, and `logs`, zero-or-more `<env>/<service>` glob patterns are passed as positional argv — **patterns are forwarded verbatim** from the user's command line; winter never expands them before dispatch. The orchestrator owns the catalog and is responsible for expanding them.

**Patterns are raw user tokens on argv.** There is no `--` guard between the action and the patterns, so an orchestrator must tolerate a pattern that begins with `-`. (In practice, valid `<env>/<service>` patterns never start with `-`, but a robust implementation should not assume this.) Note: at the winter CLI boundary, Click rejects a bare `-`-leading token as an unknown option (exit 2); pass it after `--` (e.g. `winter service restart -- -weird`) so Click treats it as a positional. Winter then forwards the token verbatim to the orchestrator — without a `--` guard — so the orchestrator still receives the raw token and must tolerate it.

An implementation **must accept all five action words** even if only to refuse one it does not implement: for an unsupported action it should exit non-zero with a message, which winter passes through.

### Always-present environment variables

Every dispatch — regardless of action — sets these three variables and runs the entrypoint with **cwd at the workspace root**:

| Var | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `WINTER_WORKSPACE_DIR` | Absolute path to the workspace root. |
| `WINTER_EXT_DIR` | Absolute path to this orchestrator extension's clone (the dir containing `winter-ext.toml`). |
| `WINTER_EXT_PREFIX` | The resolved symlink prefix for this extension. |

These three are winter's shared extension-subprocess context, defined for the hook/doctor/lint dispatches in [setup.md](../setup.md#hook-env-var-contract); `winter service` provides them identically. Working directory varies by surface: `winter service`, `doctor`, `lint`, and the `on_workspace_reconcile` hook run at the workspace root, while the `on_env_*` hooks run at the env root.

### Per-action environment variables

Service selection for `status`, `restart`, and `logs` is on argv (not env vars). The only per-action env vars set by winter are the `logs` render options:

| Action | Env var | Value |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `logs` | `WINTER_LOG_FOLLOW` | `1` = stream live, `0` = emit backlog and exit. |
| `logs` | `WINTER_LOG_TAIL` | Positive integer or `all`. The orchestrator SHOULD honour this; winter applies a backstop. |
| `logs` | `WINTER_LOG_SINCE` | RFC3339 absolute timestamp (pre-normalised from any duration); empty if unset. |
| `logs` | `WINTER_LOG_UNTIL` | RFC3339 absolute timestamp; empty if unset. |
| `logs` | `WINTER_LOG_TIMESTAMPS` | `1` = per-line timestamps requested; `0` = not requested. |

For `up`, `down`, and `status`, no action-specific env vars are set beyond the always-present three above. Specifically for `status`: `--json` is a **winter-side render toggle only** — it is never propagated to the orchestrator as an env var or an argv token. The orchestrator argv is byte-identical with and without `--json`: `[<entrypoint>, "status", *patterns]`.

### Wire contract (orchestrator stdout → winter)

#### `logs` wire contract

The orchestrator's stdout for `logs` must be **NDJSON**, one event per line:

```json
{"ts":"2026-06-13T10:00:01Z","env":"alpha","svc":"api","msg":"listening"}
{"env":"alpha","svc":"worker","msg":"processing job 42"}
```

Fields:
- `env` (required) — the feature-environment the service belongs to.
- `svc` (required) — the originating service name.
- `msg` (required) — the log message.
- `ts` (optional) — RFC3339 timestamp; omit when the backend has no per-line timestamps (e.g. `tmux capture-pane`).

The orchestrator's **stderr must reach winter's stderr** (diagnostics), NOT be merged into the NDJSON stdout. The orchestrator MAY pre-filter by `WINTER_LOG_SINCE`/`UNTIL`/`FOLLOW`/`TAIL` server-side for efficiency; winter applies idempotent backstops regardless.

#### `status` wire contract

The orchestrator **must always emit a single schema-valid JSON status document on stdout** for the `status` action — unconditionally, regardless of whether `--json` was set at the winter CLI (that flag never reaches the orchestrator). Winter captures the full stdout, parses the document, applies the backstop filter, and renders to the user.

The document schema (env-keyed):

```json
{
  "envs": [
    {
      "env": "alpha",
      "session": "mp-alpha",
      "port_base": 4020,
      "services": [
        {
          "name": "api",
          "state": "running",
          "health": "healthy",
          "ports": [7503],
          "handle": "<tmux pane or container id>",
          "log_path": "/abs/path/to/api.log",
          "since": "2026-06-19T10:00:00Z"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Allowed enum values:
- `state`: `"running"` | `"stopped"` | `"unknown"`
- `health`: `"healthy"` | `"unhealthy"` | `"unknown"`

Null / empty conventions:
- `session`, `handle`, `log_path`, `since` — use JSON `null` when the value is unknown or unavailable.
- `port_base` — use JSON `null` when unknown.
- `ports` — use `[]` (empty array) when no ports are known.

**Shape-stability rule:** every field listed above is always present in the emitted document. Consumers rely on shape stability, never on field omission. When an enum value is not recognised, emit the literal string `"unknown"`. When a scalar value is not available, emit `null`. `ports` is always a list, never `null`.

An empty `{"envs": []}` is a valid, non-error document (no services currently visible).

The orchestrator's **stderr must reach winter's stderr** (diagnostics), NOT be merged into the JSON stdout — mirroring the `logs` contract.

### Render contract (winter stdout → user/pipe)

#### `logs` render contract

Winter parses the NDJSON and writes plain lines to its own stdout: `[<ts> ][<env>/<svc> | ]<msg>`.

- Prefix `<env>/<svc> | ` **unless the selection is a single literal `<env>/<service>` pattern** — i.e., exactly one pattern that contains `/` and has no glob metacharacter (`*`, `?`, or `[`). Everything else (a bare `<env>`, a wildcard, multiple patterns, or no patterns) is multi-scope and gets the prefix so merged output stays attributable.
- Under `-t`/`--timestamps`, prepend the RFC3339 timestamp; lines without a `ts` field are rendered without a timestamp prefix (with one stderr warning emitted).
- Lines that are not valid JSON are treated leniently: the whole raw line becomes `msg` with no `env`, `svc`, or `ts`.
- winter's own warnings and diagnostics go to stderr. This plain-line stdout is what makes `winter service logs alpha | grep ERROR | less` portable across orchestrators.

#### `status` render contract

Winter captures the orchestrator's status stdout, parses the JSON document, applies the segment-aware backstop service filter (same pattern matcher used for `logs` and `winter ws` PATTERNS), and renders the result:

- **Default (human table):** a per-env section is printed for each env in the filtered document. Each section opens with a bold header showing `<env>  session=<session>  port_base=<port_base>` (values replaced with `-` when `null`), followed by a table with columns **SERVICE, STATE, HEALTH, PORTS, SINCE, HANDLE**. `state` and `health` values are styled by colour (running/healthy = green, stopped/unhealthy = red, unknown = dim). `ports` is comma-separated; empty becomes `-`. `since` and `handle` are `null`-coalesced to `-`. `log_path` is available only via `--json` and is not shown in the human table. When the filtered document has no envs, winter prints `no services`. For debugging, `log_path` (and all per-field data) is accessible via `winter service status --json`; pair with `winter service logs` to read the log content directly.
- **`--json`:** winter re-serialises the parsed-and-filtered `StatusDocument` to canonical JSON (`json.dumps` with `indent=2`) and writes it to stdout, and nothing else. The key order matches the schema above. This is a re-serialisation of the parsed model, not a raw passthrough of the orchestrator's bytes.

**Graceful degradation:** if the orchestrator's stdout cannot be parsed as a conformant status document (bad JSON, top-level value is not a dict, or the `envs` key is missing or not a list), winter writes a clear actionable error to stderr and exits non-zero. The error names the failing orchestrator entrypoint and prefix and instructs the operator to ensure the extension is up to date. No stack trace is printed.

### Idempotent backstop filters (winter-side)

Winter applies these backstops even when the orchestrator has pre-filtered, ensuring the user-facing contract holds regardless of orchestrator quality:

- **Service filter (logs):** each line's `env` and `svc` fields are joined as `<env>/<svc>` and matched against the requested patterns using the same segment-aware matcher that `winter ws` PATTERNS uses; if no pattern matches, the line is dropped. Lines missing the `env` or `svc` field are dropped when a filter is active (i.e., when patterns are present).
- **Service filter (status):** when patterns are present, each service in the parsed `StatusDocument` is tested via the same segment-aware matcher (`<env>/<service-name>`); services that do not match any pattern are dropped. Envs whose service list becomes empty after filtering are dropped entirely. When no patterns are given, the document is returned unchanged.
- **Time filter — `(logs)` only (`--since`/`--until`):** applied per-line only to lines that have a parseable `ts`. The boundary is **inclusive**: a line whose `ts` exactly equals the `--since` or `--until` threshold is kept. Lines without `ts` are always kept (winter cannot time-filter them). If `--since`/`--until` was requested AND at least one line lacked a `ts`, winter emits one stderr warning that the time filter is partial.
- **Timestamps — `(logs)` only (`-t`):** if requested but a line has no `ts`, the timestamp prefix is omitted for that line; winter emits one stderr warning.
- **Tail backstop — `(logs)` only:** in **non-follow** mode, winter keeps a ring buffer (last N lines) and emits only those after the stream ends. In **follow** mode (`-f`), winter does NOT re-tail — it relays lines live and relies on the orchestrator having honoured `WINTER_LOG_TAIL`. This is an intentional limitation: winter cannot distinguish backlog from live output during a follow session.

### Exit codes

- Click owns flag-parse errors: exit 2 (before dispatch).
- The orchestrator's exit code becomes `winter`'s exit code.
- `-f` interrupted by Ctrl-C: exit 130 (and the child receives the signal naturally).
- **`status` conformance failure:** if the orchestrator's stdout is not a conformant status document, winter exits non-zero even if the orchestrator itself exited 0. The rule: the orchestrator's own non-zero exit code wins; if the orchestrator exited 0, winter synthesises exit code 1. The actionable error is written to stderr.
