# `winter ws destroy` — tear down a feature env

For the rest of the family, see the [`winter ws` hub](./index.md). `winter ws destroy ENV` is the symmetric counterpart to [`winter ws init ENV`](./init.md):

1. **Provision teardown** — runs `data --destroy` then `resource --destroy` (reverse of apply order) using the `[[provision.*]]` handlers declared in `.winter/config.toml` and extension manifests. Handlers without a declared `destroy` script warn and no-op without aborting structural teardown. Pass `--no-provision-teardown` to skip this phase entirely.
2. **Safety check** — refuses on missing env path or dirty worktrees (override with `--force`).
3. **Hooks** — fires every extension's `on_env_destroy` hook (mirror of `on_env_init`). With `--strict`, a non-zero hook exit aborts the teardown; without it, hook failures are logged and teardown proceeds.
4. **Worktree removal** — `git worktree remove` for every per-repo worktree.
5. **Env cleanup** — removes the env directory, strips the matching `# >>> winter-dir/<env>` block from the workspace's `.git/info/exclude`, and removes the env's index entry from `.winter/state.toml`.

Use `--dry-run` to preview the plan with no side effects — the provision teardown plan (which `destroy` scripts would run) is emitted first, followed by the structural plan.

**`--strict` behaviour for provision teardown:** when a `destroy` script exits non-zero, `--strict` aborts the entire teardown *before* removing worktrees or the env directory, preventing resources from being orphaned. Without `--strict`, the failure is surfaced as an error (and the command exits non-zero) but structural removal proceeds.

**Prefer this over `rm -rf <env>/` + manual `git worktree remove`.** Manual removal bypasses provision teardown and `on_env_destroy` hooks — extensions that need to clean up per-env state (tmux sessions, watchers, provisioned DBs, RMQ vhosts, buckets) get skipped, leaving provisioned resources orphaned.

## `--json` action vocabulary

`winter ws destroy --json` emits NDJSON. The structural actions appear alongside any provision-teardown actions from the same stream:

| `action` | Phase | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `provision_teardown_started` | 2a | Provision teardown is beginning; `detail` is `data → resource` |
| `provision_subtarget_started` | 2a | A teardown sub-target is starting |
| `provision_no_handlers` | 2a | No handlers declared for a sub-target |
| `provision_handler_done` | 2a | A teardown handler completed; `detail` is the action (`destroy`) |
| `provision_handler_warn` | 2a | Handler skipped (no `destroy` script); `detail` is the warning message |
| `provision_teardown_finished` | 2a | All teardown subtargets done; `detail` is `"ok"` or `"error"` |
| `would_provision_teardown` | dry-run | Handler that would run; `detail` is `destroy: <script>` |
| `worktree_removed` | 4 | A per-repo worktree was removed |
| `env_removed` | 5 | The env directory was removed |
| `workspace_excludes_updated` | 5 | The `# >>> winter-dir/<env>` block was stripped from `.git/info/exclude` |
| `would_remove_worktree` | dry-run | Worktree that would be removed |
| `would_remove_env` | dry-run | Env directory that would be removed |
| `would_remove_workspace_exclude` | dry-run | Exclude block that would be stripped |
