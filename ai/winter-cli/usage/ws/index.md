# `winter ws` — workspace and environment commands

The `winter ws` family manages source checkouts and feature environments across the workspace. This is the family hub: skim the command table, then open the one command's file you need. For the rest of the CLI surface, see the [command reference](../index.md).

## Commands

Command names below link to a per-command file where one exists; the lighter commands are fully described by their row.

| Command | Usage | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| [`init`](./init.md) | `winter ws init [TARGET] [--all] [--json]` | Reconcile source checkouts or a feature environment against the config |
| [`destroy`](./destroy.md) | `winter ws destroy ENV [--force\|--strict\|--dry-run] [--json]` | Tear down a feature env: fire `on_env_destroy` hooks, then remove every per-repo worktree and the env directory |
| [`checkout`](./checkout.md) | `winter ws checkout ENV FEATURE_BRANCH [--new] [--force] [--json]` | Connect every non-pinned worktree in ENV to FEATURE_BRANCH and reset to it (or to `origin/<main>` where it doesn't exist), all-or-nothing |
| `list` | `winter ws list [--json]` | List all feature environments |
| [`status`](./status.md) | `winter ws status [PATTERNS]... [--json] [--fetch]` | Machine-readable + human-readable workspace state snapshot |
| [`fetch`](./fetch.md) | `winter ws fetch [PATTERNS]... [--standalone\|--all] [--json]` | Fetch refs from `origin` for matched project worktrees, and fast-forward each matched source checkout's local main |
| [`pull`](./pull.md) | `winter ws pull [PATTERNS]... [--standalone\|--all] [--ff-only\|--merge\|--rebase] [--autostash] [--json]` | Fetch + ff-only integrate (default) matched project worktrees |
| [`merge`](./merge.md) | `winter ws merge SOURCE_REF [PATTERNS]... [--standalone\|--all] [--ff-only\|--merge\|--no-ff] [--autostash] [--exclude-pinned\|--only-pinned] [--json]` | Merge an arbitrary SOURCE_REF (env name, branch, `origin/...`) into matched project worktrees |
| [`push`](./push.md) | `winter ws push [PATTERNS]... [--standalone\|--all] [--include-pinned\|--only-pinned] [--json]` | Push matched project worktrees to their tracked upstream |
| `connect` | `winter ws connect ENV FEATURE_BRANCH [--json]` | Connect a feature environment to a remote feature branch |
| `disconnect` | `winter ws disconnect ENV [--json]` | Disconnect a feature environment from its feature branch |
| `diff` | `winter ws diff ENV [--staged\|--branch] [--repo REPO] [--no-headers] [--json]` | Unified diff across all repos in a feature environment (`--no-headers` omits the per-repo separator headers) |
| `index` | `winter ws index NAME [--json]` | Print the port-offset index for a feature environment name (Greek = 1..24, other = hashed 26..281) |
| [`prune`](./prune.md) | `winter ws prune [--dry-run\|--force] [--json]` | Remove disk state for repos no longer in the workspace config (orphan clones, broken `.claude/` symlinks). Refuses repos with uncommitted changes or attached worktrees |
| `worktrees` | `winter ws worktrees [--status] [--json]` | List every existing feature-environment worktree and standalone repo as a flat table or JSON array — intended for editor integrations (e.g. Neovim fuzzy-finder `cd` picker). Each entry's `kind` is one of `worktree` \| `standalone` \| `workspace`; the implicit workspace repo is the single `workspace` entry, labelled `<workspace>`. Omits entries whose directory does not exist on disk. `--status` adds per-repo git status (ahead/behind/dirty) at the cost of a git call per repo |

The four remote-sync commands — `fetch`, `pull`, `push`, `merge` — share a [pattern and scope vocabulary](./patterns.md) (segment-glob `PATTERNS`, `--standalone`/`--all`, pinned-scope rules). Read that once; each command's file covers only its own deltas.
