# Winter CLI — Setup

Installation and configuration reference. For day-to-day command usage, see [usage.md](./usage.md).

## Installation

```bash
./tools/winter-cli/install.sh
```

This copies the `winter` wrapper to `~/.local/bin/`. The wrapper auto-discovers the workspace root by searching upward for `.winter/config.toml` + `tools/winter-cli/`, then runs via `mise` and `uv` — no manual virtualenv setup needed.

## Configuration

Winter loads two files and merges them:

- `.winter/config.toml` — committed workspace config (repo list, excludes, defaults)
- `.winter/config.local.toml` — gitignored overlay for per-user settings (git identity)

### Shared config (`.winter/config.toml`)

```toml
session_prefix = "my-project"                 # tmux session prefix
main_branch = "main"                          # workspace-default main branch (per-repo override below)
adopt_extensions = "winter"                   # how aggressively standalone repos contribute skills/agents
doctor = "ai/project/doctor.sh"               # optional; workspace-level `winter doctor` probe script (see Doctor below)
service_orchestrator = "winter-service-tmux"  # optional; extension that handles `winter service` (see Service orchestration below)

# Entries appended to every repo's .git/info/exclude on `winter ws init`.
git_excludes = ["*.Local.csproj"]

# Project repositories — cloned to projects/ and worktreed into Greek-letter dirs.
# Entries appear in CLI and TUI output in the order they're listed here, so put
# high-priority repos first.
[[project_repository]]
name = "web"                               # directory name under projects/ — overrides what would be derived from `url`
url = "git@example.com:org/winter-app.git"
cmd = ["pnpm install"]                     # run after clone and in every worktree
git_excludes = [".env.development.local"]  # per-repo excludes, merged with workspace-wide

[[project_repository]]
name = "api"
url = "git@example.com:org/winter-api.git"
main_branch = "development"        # per-repo override of the top-level main_branch
cmd = ["dotnet restore"]

# Pinned repos always track origin/main and are skipped during feature branching.
[[project_repository]]
name = "shared-tools"
url = "git@example.com:org/shared-tools.git"
pinned = true

# Standalone repositories — cloned to the workspace root (or `path`), no worktree,
# no feature branching. Useful for winter extensions (skills/agents) and any repo
# you want available alongside project repos but not multiplied per-feature.
[[standalone_repository]]
name = "winter-backlog"
url = "git@github.com:user/winter-backlog.git"
prefix = "wsb"                     # optional symlink-prefix override; see "Extensions" below
path = "extensions/winter-backlog" # optional; relative to the workspace root, defaults to `name`
```

### Local overlay (`.winter/config.local.toml`)

```toml
[git]
user.name = "John Doe"
user.email = "john.doe@example.com"
```

The overlay uses the same schema as the shared config. Keys in the overlay override the shared config key-by-key. The `[git]` identity is applied to every repo winter-cli manages during `winter ws init`.

### Keybindings

The `winter dashboard` TUI binds each action to a configurable key. Override the defaults in a `[keybindings]` table; the `config.local.toml` overlay applies per-machine, merging key-by-key.

```toml
[keybindings]
leader = "\\"          # what <leader> expands to (default backslash); single key spec
timeoutlen = 1000      # ms to wait for the next key of a chord sequence (Neovim's timeoutlen)

# Action id -> key spec. Quoted ids keep the dotted name flat (not nested tables).
# Absent ids keep their built-in default. Full id list + grammar: usage.md#keybindings.
[keybindings.bindings]
"workspace.refresh" = "<C-r>"     # modifier chord
"worktree.open_detail" = "o"      # rebind Enter for opening a row's detail
"workspace.open_log" = "<leader>l" # leader chord sequence
"plugin.codediff" = "<leader>d"   # remap a plugin action by its plugin.<name> id
```

The `[keybindings.bindings]` keys are *quoted* action ids — the quotes keep a dotted id (`workspace.refresh`) a flat key instead of a nested TOML table. For the action-id reference, the full key-spec grammar, and the invalid-spec / unknown-id behavior, see [usage.md#keybindings](./usage.md#keybindings).

### Display names and ordering

`name` doubles as the directory under `projects/` and as the user-facing label everywhere a repo is shown (grid columns, status tables, sync/push/diff headers). When `name` is omitted, it's derived from the trailing path segment of `url` (with `.git` stripped). Set `name` explicitly when you want a friendlier label than the canonical repo name.

Repos appear in CLI tables and the TUI grid in the order they're declared in `.winter/config.toml`. Put the repos you work with most often at the top.

### Implicit Repositories

The `workspace` repo is discovered implicitly — it doesn't appear in `[[project_repository]]` or `[[standalone_repository]]`. Winter detects it from the filesystem: the workspace itself is the repo this CLI is invoked from.

## Extensions

Standalone repositories can opt into contributing skills and agents to the workspace's `.claude/` directory by shipping a `winter-ext.toml` file at the repo root.

### `winter-ext.toml` schema

```toml
name = "winter-backlog"        # default symlink prefix when no override is set
prefix = "wsb"                 # optional shorter prefix; takes precedence over `name`
skills_dir = "skills"          # optional; explicit path overrides default discovery
agents_dir = "agents"          # optional; explicit path overrides default discovery
doctor = "scripts/doctor.sh"   # optional; executable that emits NDJSON probe events for `winter doctor`
lint = "scripts/lint.sh"       # optional; executable(s) emitting NDJSON findings for `winter lint` (str or list)
orchestrate_services = "workflow/service"   # optional; executable entrypoint for `winter service` (see Service orchestration below)
requires = ["winter-product"]  # optional; other modules this one depends on (see `winter graph`)
```

`requires` declares the other winter modules this one references and therefore needs when installed on its own. Each entry is a module name — the `<context>` half of a `<context>:/path` reference. It is the data `winter graph` aggregates and the module-extractability lint check validates references against.

The final symlink prefix is resolved with this precedence: `prefix` on the workspace config entry > `prefix` in `winter-ext.toml` > `name` in `winter-ext.toml` > the standalone repo's directory name.

### What gets symlinked

When `skills_dir` and `agents_dir` aren't set explicitly, winter searches for them in this order and uses the first that exists:

- `skills/` then `.claude/skills/`
- `agents/` then `.claude/agents/`

That covers both the winter convention (top-level `skills/`/`agents/`) and the Claude Code convention (`.claude/skills/`/`.claude/agents/`), so a vanilla Claude Code repo can be adopted as an extension without modification. Setting `skills_dir`/`agents_dir` explicitly in `winter-ext.toml` skips the fallback and uses exactly the declared path.

For each subdirectory under the resolved skills root, winter creates a symlink at `.claude/skills/<prefix>-<dir>` pointing to it. For each `.md` file or subdirectory under the resolved agents root, winter creates a symlink at `.claude/agents/<prefix>-<name>`.

The workspace `.gitignore` is updated with a marker-bracketed block per extension:

```
# >>> winter-backlog (managed by winter)
/winter-backlog/
.claude/skills/wsb-*
.claude/agents/wsb-*
# <<< winter-backlog
```

### Frontmatter convention

Claude Code lets a SKILL.md frontmatter `name` field override the directory name during skill discovery. That defeats the prefix-by-symlink design, so winter requires extension SKILL.md files to **omit the `name` field** — letting the directory name (which winter controls via the symlink) be authoritative. Winter validates this on install and refuses if any SKILL.md sets `name`.

### Extension hooks

Extensions can also declare lifecycle hooks in `winter-ext.toml`:

```toml
[hooks]
on_env_init    = "./hooks/init-worktree.sh"
on_env_destroy = "./hooks/destroy-worktree.sh"
```

- `on_env_init` fires after `winter ws init <env>` creates every per-repo worktree and seeds `.winter.env`. Use it to provision per-env state (tmux sessions, databases, watchers).
- `on_env_destroy` fires *before* `winter ws destroy <env>` removes any per-repo worktree or the env directory. Use it to release whatever `on_env_init` provisioned.

Hook scripts must be **relative paths inside the extension directory** (so the extension owns its scripts; winter resolves them against the extension root).

#### Hook env-var contract

Every hook is invoked with:

| Var | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `WINTER_WORKSPACE_DIR` | Absolute path to the workspace root. |
| `WINTER_EXT_DIR` | Absolute path to this extension's clone (the dir containing `winter-ext.toml`). |
| `WINTER_EXT_PREFIX` | The resolved symlink prefix for this extension (`wf`, `wst`, …). |
| `WINTER_ENV` | The env name (`alpha`, `beta`, …). |
| `WINTER_ENV_INDEX` | The port-offset index (1..24 for Greek letters, hashed 26..281 otherwise). |
| `WINTER_PORT_BASE` | `4000 + 100 * WINTER_ENV_INDEX`. |

The hook's **cwd is the env root** (`<workspace>/<env>/`). Hooks should read these env vars rather than parse `argv`.

**Strict vs non-strict on destroy.** By default, a non-zero exit from a destroy hook is logged and the teardown continues so a broken hook doesn't trap an env on disk. Pass `--strict` to `winter ws destroy` (or set it in CI/scripted use) when a hook failure must surface as a user-actionable error before any worktree is removed.

### `adopt_extensions` modes

The top-level `adopt_extensions` field controls when winter processes a standalone repo's skills and agents:

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `winter` (default) | Process only standalone repos that have a `winter-ext.toml` at the repo root. SKILL.md frontmatter is strictly validated. |
| `all` | Process any standalone repo with `skills/`, `agents/`, `.claude/skills/`, or `.claude/agents/` directories, with or without a manifest. Frontmatter validation downgrades from refuse-to-warn — collisions become the user's problem. |
| `none` | Skip all extension processing. Standalone repos are still cloned, but no symlinks are created. |

## Service orchestration

`winter service` (see [usage.md#service](./usage.md#service)) owns a stable `up`/`down`/`status`/`restart`/`logs` interface and dispatches each invocation to a single orchestrator extension the workspace registers. The interface lives in core winter; the implementation lives in whichever extension the workspace points at (tmux, containers, a daemon), so consumers never depend on the implementation.

### Registering an orchestrator

Two distinctly-named keys connect the interface to an implementation:

- **Workspace config** — a top-level `service_orchestrator = "<extension-name>"` in `.winter/config.toml` (or the `config.local.toml` overlay) naming an installed extension. The name must match a `[[standalone_repository]]` that ships a `winter-ext.toml`.
- **Extension manifest** — an `orchestrate_services = "<path>"` key in that extension's `winter-ext.toml`, an executable entrypoint relative to the extension's repo root.

With both in place, `winter service <action> <env>` resolves the orchestrator and runs its entrypoint. With either missing — no `service_orchestrator` in config.toml, a name matching no installed extension, or an extension without an `orchestrate_services` entrypoint key in winter-ext.toml — the command fails naming the specific gap. Only one orchestrator is supported; there is no per-env selection.

### Entrypoint contract

The full implementer-facing contract — uniform argv rule, per-action env vars, NDJSON wire format, plain-line render format, idempotent backstop filters, tail-with-follow limitation, and exit codes — lives in [usage.md#orchestrator-contract](./usage.md#orchestrator-contract). A third-party orchestrator can conform without reading winter's source.

## Doctor probes

`winter doctor` (see [usage.md#doctor](./usage.md#doctor)) aggregates probe results from three sources: built-in core checks in winter-cli, an optional workspace-level probe, and one probe per installed extension. The workspace and extension probes are opt-in shell scripts that follow the same output contract.

### Probe output contract

Every probe script emits **NDJSON to stdout**, one object per line:

```json
{"name": "tea auth", "status": "pass", "message": "logged in as pgross"}
{"name": "tmux version", "status": "warn", "message": "v2.8 (recommend >= 3.0)", "remediation": "Upgrade tmux: `dnf install tmux`."}
```

Required fields: `name` (string) and `status` (one of `pass` / `warn` / `fail`). Optional: `message` (one-line summary) and `remediation` (one-line fix hint, shown under failures in the table view).

**Exit handling.** A non-zero exit becomes a single synthetic `fail` result with the probe's stderr as the message — surfaced even if no NDJSON was emitted. Lines that don't parse as JSON, or that are missing required fields, become `warn` results so the contract violation is visible without aborting the run.

**Common misconfigurations** (workspace and extension probes alike): a missing `doctor` field is silently skipped; a `doctor` value pointing at a missing script surfaces as a `fail`; a script that exists but isn't executable surfaces as a `fail` so the misconfiguration is actionable; a path that escapes its declaring directory (workspace root for workspace probes, extension directory for extension probes) is refused.

### Workspace doctor probe

The workspace itself can contribute a probe script that runs between the core probes and each extension's probes. Declare it as a top-level field in `.winter/config.toml`:

```toml
doctor = "ai/project/doctor.sh"
```

The path is **relative to the workspace root** and must point to an executable file. The probe runs with cwd at the workspace root and `WINTER_WORKSPACE_DIR` set. Use it for project-specific checks that don't belong in any extension — database reachable, `.env` populated, secrets present, build toolchain installed.

Results appear under a `[project]` source group in the table view, between `[core]` and each `[<ext-prefix>]` block.

### Extension doctor probes

Extensions opt in via a top-level field in `winter-ext.toml`:

```toml
doctor = "scripts/doctor.sh"
```

`doctor` is a **top-level scalar** in `winter-ext.toml`, not part of `[hooks]` — there's at most one probe script per extension. The path is **relative to the extension directory** (same rule as hook scripts) and must point to an executable file.

The probe's **cwd is the workspace root**. Probes are workspace-scoped, not per-env, so the env vars are a subset of the hook contract:

| Var | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `WINTER_WORKSPACE_DIR` | Absolute path to the workspace root. |
| `WINTER_EXT_DIR` | Absolute path to this extension's clone. |
| `WINTER_EXT_PREFIX` | The resolved symlink prefix for this extension. |

Results appear under a `[<ext-prefix>]` source group, one block per installed extension that contributes probes.

## Lint checks

`winter lint` (see [usage.md#lint](./usage.md#lint)) is the convention-checking counterpart of `winter doctor`. It's a dispatcher: it discovers lint scripts contributed by the workspace and by installed extensions, runs the applicable ones over the selected scope, and aggregates their findings. It owns scope selection, aggregation, and reporting — the check logic lives entirely in the contributed scripts.

### Finding output contract

A lint script follows the **same NDJSON contract as a doctor probe** ([above](#probe-output-contract)) with two additions per object — `check` (the field name; `name` is also accepted as an alias, so an existing doctor probe can be repointed at lint with minimal change) and optional `file` / `line` location fields:

```json
{"check": "path-notation", "status": "fail", "message": "non-canonical ref `../harness`", "file": "ai/index.md", "line": 12, "remediation": "Use the `winter-harness:` prefix."}
{"check": "agent-frontmatter", "status": "warn", "message": "missing `model`", "file": ".claude/agents/wf-developer.md"}
```

Required fields: `check` (string) and `status` (`pass` / `warn` / `fail`). Optional: `message`, `file`, `line`, `remediation`. Exit handling and misconfiguration behavior (missing field silently skipped; missing / non-executable / directory-escaping script surfaces as a `fail`; unparseable lines become `warn`) match the doctor probe contract exactly.

### Scope environment variables

On top of the doctor probe's env (`WINTER_WORKSPACE_DIR`, and for extension scripts also `WINTER_EXT_DIR` / `WINTER_EXT_PREFIX`), every lint script receives the resolved scope:

| Var | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `WINTER_LINT_SCOPE` | The scope kind: `all`, `repo`, `env`, or `changed`. |
| `WINTER_LINT_PATHS` | Newline-delimited absolute paths in scope. Under `changed` these are individual **files**; under `all` / `repo` / `env` they are **directory** roots. A check must `stat` each path and handle both. |
| `WINTER_CLI` | Absolute path to the winter CLI that launched the run. A check may call back into it for workspace-wide data it can't derive from its own scope — e.g. `$WINTER_CLI graph --json` for the dependency graph — instead of rebuilding it. A check must **never** call `winter lint` (that recurses). |

**A check MUST confine itself to `WINTER_LINT_PATHS`.** `winter lint` runs every contributed script for every scope and never filters by content — keeping a run "applicable to that scope" is the script's job. A check walks the given paths, applies its rules only to files under them, and emits nothing for a scope whose content it doesn't recognize.

- **Do**: iterate `WINTER_LINT_PATHS`, walk each (a file is itself; a directory is recursed), match the files you own, stay silent otherwise.
- **Don't**: glob the whole workspace, read `$WINTER_WORKSPACE_DIR` wholesale, or use the current directory — that leaks findings outside the scope and silently breaks `--changed` and per-repo runs.

### Workspace lint check

The workspace contributes a lint script via a top-level field in `.winter/config.toml`, symmetric with the workspace doctor probe:

```toml
lint = "ai/project/lint.sh"             # single script
lint = ["ai/project/lint.sh", "ai/project/lint_docs.sh"]   # or a list
```

`lint` accepts a single path or a list; a bare string is coerced to a one-element list. Paths are **relative to the workspace root** and must point to executable files. They run first, before extension checks, with cwd at the workspace root, and their findings appear under a `[project]` source group. Use them for checks this specific workspace owns. Ecosystem-general checks meant to travel between workspaces belong in an installed extension instead (the `lint` field below) — e.g. a dedicated `winter-lint` extension hosting the cross-cutting checks no single domain extension owns.

### Extension lint checks

Extensions opt in via the top-level `lint` field in `winter-ext.toml` (paths **relative to the extension directory**, executable). Like the workspace field, it accepts a single path or a list — an extension that contributes several distinct checks (say, one per convention) lists them all, and each runs as its own script. Each runs with cwd at the workspace root and the scope env vars above; findings appear under the extension's `[<ext-prefix>]` source group.

A minimal check skeleton — walk the scope, match the files you own, emit one finding per violation, stay silent on the rest:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Flag Markdown files that reference the harness with a bare relative path
# instead of the canonical `winter-harness:` notation.
set -euo pipefail

emit() { printf '{"check":"path-notation","status":"%s","message":"%s","file":"%s","line":%s}\n' "$1" "$2" "$3" "$4"; }

while IFS= read -r path; do
  [ -z "$path" ] && continue
  # A directory root is recursed; a single changed file is checked directly.
  while IFS= read -r md; do
    while IFS=: read -r line _; do
      emit fail "use the \`winter-harness:\` prefix" "$md" "$line"
    done < <(grep -nE '\.\./harness' "$md" || true)
  done < <(find "$path" -type f -name '*.md' 2>/dev/null)
done <<< "$WINTER_LINT_PATHS"
```

Exit non-zero only for the script's own failures — winter turns that into a synthetic `fail`. A clean run that found nothing exits `0` and emits nothing.
