# Drift guard: winter service subcommands must match the service-v1 spec.
#
# Each action declared in service-v1.toml must have a registered Click subcommand
# with a matching short_help summary.  If someone edits the spec or the command
# module out of agreement this test fails, preventing silent drift between the
# machine-readable contract and the user-facing help text.
