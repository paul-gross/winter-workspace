"""Stable action ids for every built-in dashboard action.

Each built-in action has a documented, config-addressable id (`workspace.refresh`,
`worktree.open_detail`, `app.quit`, ...). Config maps these ids to key specs; an
absent id falls back to the `default` here. Plugin actions get ids of the form
`plugin.<name>` (built dynamically from the plugin registry).

The agent-facing list of ids lives in `winter:/ai/winter-cli/usage/dashboard.md` —
keep it in sync when adding, renaming, or removing an entry here.
