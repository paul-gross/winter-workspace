    `candidates` is every installed extension that declares it provides this slot.
    `bound_extension` is the explicit config binding name (from `capabilities.<slot>`) if any.
    `binding_kind` is one of: "explicit" (config binding to a valid provider),
        "implicit" (sole provider, no config binding), "unbound" (0 or ≥2 providers, no binding),

        entrypoint missing).
    `error` is a human-readable string for `binding_kind == "invalid"`; None otherwise.

    Note on explicit-vs-implicit asymmetry: an explicit binding whose entrypoint file is
    missing is reported as `invalid` (with `error` set). An implicit sole provider whose
    entrypoint is missing stays `implicit` (entrypoint validity is carried on the candidate's
    `entrypoint_valid` and re-checked by `resolve()`/the doctor probe). Do not "fix" this
    asymmetry — it is deliberate: an explicit binding is a user assertion that must be valid,
    while an implicit provider is a discovery result that may be partially configured.

    Note on ambiguity: there is no dedicated "ambiguous" kind. When
    `binding_kind == "unbound"` and `len(candidates) >= 2`, the slot is ambiguous.
    Use the `is_ambiguous` property rather than checking the combination inline.
