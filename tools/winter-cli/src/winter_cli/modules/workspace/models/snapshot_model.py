    Fields
    ------
    name:
        Matches ``[[standalone_repository]].name`` in the config.
    ref:
        The ``ref`` string from the config (branch name, tag, or commit SHA).
    kind:
        How the ref is classified: ``"branch"``, ``"tag"``, or ``"commit"``.
        ``None`` when the lock entry is absent (never been pinned/updated).
    locked_commit:
        The full 40-character SHA recorded in ``.winter/config.lock`` at
        the last ``ws update`` or ``ws init``. ``None`` when no lock entry
        exists yet.
    config_ref_drift:
        True when the lock file records a *different* ref than what the config
        currently declares (lock is stale — a ``ws update`` is needed).
        False when they match or when no lock entry exists.
    head_drift:
        True when the repo's HEAD commit does not match ``locked_commit``
        (the checkout has drifted from the recorded pin). False when they
        match or when no lock entry exists.
    head_commit:
        The current HEAD commit of the standalone repo (full 40-char SHA), or
        ``None`` when the repo is absent on disk or the probe fails.
