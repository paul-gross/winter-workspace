    """Dispatches up/down/restart to the registered service orchestrator(s).

    For ``up`` and ``down``, uses ``ServiceFanOutService`` to fan out across the
    ordered provider list with no readiness gate or ordering semantics.

    For ``restart`` with multiple providers, builds the service-to-provider ownership
    index via ``ServiceDescribeService``, groups matched services by owning provider,
    and dispatches each provider only the services it owns.  With a single provider,
    ``restart`` behaves exactly as before (no ``describe`` call, patterns forwarded
    verbatim).

    For other actions (``describe``, etc.), dispatches to the single resolved provider
    via the orchestrator resolver, as before.

    The orchestrator is invoked as `<entrypoint> <action> [positional...]` (argv),
    with `cwd` at the workspace root. Every dispatch exports `WINTER_WORKSPACE_DIR`,
    `WINTER_EXT_DIR`, and `WINTER_EXT_PREFIX` (matching the doctor/lint/hook
    dispatches).

    For up/down the single positional is `<env>`. For restart the positionals are
    the verbatim `<env>/<service>` selection PATTERNS forwarded unchanged on argv.
    No per-action selection env vars are set here (status is handled separately by
    ServiceStatusService; logs is handled separately by ServiceLogsService).

    The entrypoint's exit code is returned unmodified; stdout/stderr are
    inherited from the parent process (no capture).
