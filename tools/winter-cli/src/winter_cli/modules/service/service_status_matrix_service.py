"""Call-matrix enumeration, env injection, and parallel invocation for ``service status``.

``ServiceStatusMatrixService`` is the core of winter#109 Phase 2: it replaces the
per-provider single-call approach in ``ServiceStatusService`` with a two-dimensional
call-matrix where **rows are scopes** (configured env names from the registry + the
workspace scope) and **columns are owning providers**.

Design
------
The matrix is built by joining:

(a) Each provider's ``describe`` taxonomy — ``workspace/<svc>`` entries signal that
    the provider owns a workspace-scoped service, ``*/<svc>`` entries signal a
    per-env service.  A provider that returns no ``workspace/`` names produces no
    workspace cell; a provider that returns no ``*/`` names produces no env cells.

(b) The configured-env registry (``IEnvIndexRegistry.all_assignments()``).

Single-provider short-circuit
------------------------------
When exactly one provider is bound, ``describe`` is skipped (it would convey no
ownership information) and two cells are built unconditionally: one per configured
env and one workspace cell.  This mirrors the existing D1 short-circuit in
``ServiceProviderIndex.build``.  The workspace cell is always included for the sole
provider because it may own workspace services, and an empty document from the
provider is valid and fine.

Cell rules
----------
- For each provider owning ``*/`` services x each configured env  -> ENV cell.
- For each provider owning ``workspace/`` services               -> WORKSPACE cell.
- Single-provider: one ENV cell per configured env + one WORKSPACE cell.

Scope filtering
---------------
A scope-qualified pattern (``gamma/web``) narrows the matrix to the scope axis
(only the matching env/workspace produces cells) AND the provider axis (only owning
providers produce cells for that scope).  A bare env pattern (``gamma``) narrows to
that env's cells.  No patterns → the full matrix.

Per-cell env injection
----------------------
Each cell's provider subprocess environment is built as:

    build_provider_env(provider, ws_root, service_prefix)  # WINTER_WORKSPACE_DIR / EXT_* / SERVICE_PREFIX vars
    | EnvProvisionerService.compute(scope)         # WINTER_ENV / INDEX / PORT_BASE /
                                                   # WINTER_WORKSPACE_PORT_BASE + env-band vars

The provisioner is the single source of truth for all WINTER_* variables.  Each
scope's env is computed at most once per matrix run (cache).

Env is computed via ``EnvProvisionerService.compute``.  A ``ValueError`` (e.g. a
bad env-band template) does not crash ``service status``: it is caught by
``provision_scope_env``, surfaced as a diagnostic via the reporter, and degrades
that scope to **no injected env** — the scope's cells still run, reporting live
state without the ``WINTER_*`` / env-band values (same best-effort
resilience contract as describe errors in ``ServiceDescribeService.build``).
Because the env bands are workspace-global, a malformed template degrades every
scope; each emits its own diagnostic.

Per-cell invocation
-------------------
Each cell is invoked as:

    <entrypoint> status <scope>/*

(or ``<scope>/<svc>`` when the user supplied a service filter).  The explicit scope
pattern lets the provider report configured-but-stopped services via its existing
pattern expansion logic — no provider code change is needed.  Cells run in a bounded
worker pool (``concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor``).  Results are merged in
**enumeration order** (not completion order) to preserve deterministic output.

WINTER_SERVICE_MANIFEST
-----------------------
Status cells do NOT inject ``WINTER_SERVICE_MANIFEST``.  The manifest var is an
``up``-time contract: providers read it during startup to merge extension-declared
services into their live configuration.  Status does not start services; it only
queries what the provider already knows.  Injecting the manifest on status would
not change what the provider reports (it already ran ``up`` with the manifest),
and would add unnecessary subprocess overhead from ``ServiceManifestCollectorService``.

        Exit code 130 signals KeyboardInterrupt to the caller.  A parse failure
        when *reporter* is ``None`` (``collect`` path) silently returns
        ``(None, 0)`` so it does not block the poll loop.  When *reporter* is
        supplied (``report`` path) the error is surfaced via ``status_parse_error``.
