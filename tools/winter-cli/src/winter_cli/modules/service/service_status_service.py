"""Captures and renders the orchestrator's structured status document.

The orchestrator is invoked as ``<entrypoint> status <scope>/*`` (or
``<scope>/<svc>`` for a service filter) with stdout piped.  Winter parses
the captured stdout as a ``StatusDocument``, applies the backstop filter,
then either re-serialises to canonical JSON (``--json``) or renders a human
table.  The orchestrator argv is byte-identical whether or not ``--json`` is
set — ``--json`` is never sent to the orchestrator.

Multi-provider call-matrix (Phase 2, winter#109)
-------------------------------------------------
The status action builds a two-dimensional call-matrix: rows are scope
instances (configured env names + the workspace scope), columns are owning
providers.  Core enumerates the matrix via ``ServiceStatusMatrixService``,
computes the full env map for each scope via ``EnvProvisionerService``,
injects ``WINTER_ENV``/``WINTER_ENV_INDEX``/``WINTER_PORT_BASE`` and all
env-band vars into each provider subprocess, runs cells in parallel,
and merges the per-cell documents into a single ``StatusDocument`` before
filtering and rendering.

For scope-qualified patterns (containing ``/``), the matrix is narrowed to
matching ``(provider, scope)`` cells — both the provider axis (ownership,
derived from ``describe``) and the scope axis (only matching envs/scopes
produce cells).  Bare patterns (``gamma``) narrow only the scope axis; all
providers that own services for that scope are included.  Bare ``status``
(no patterns) → full matrix.

Single-provider (D1 short-circuit)
-----------------------------------
When exactly one provider is bound, the call-matrix also applies: one cell per
configured env + one workspace cell, each with the injected env trio.  The
provider is invoked once per cell (not once for all scopes) so stopped envs are
enumerated via the explicit per-cell ``<env>/*`` pattern.

``collect`` (readiness gate)
-----------------------------
``collect`` (called by ``up --wait`` on every poll tick) is scoped to a single
env by construction — the pattern from ``ServiceReadinessService.wait`` is
always a bare env name.  The matrix degenerates to a single cell per provider
for that env, keeping the poll cheap.  ``collect`` silently skips parse errors
(unchanged).

Resolves providers and delegates to the injected ``ServiceStatusMatrixService``;
merges, filters, and renders results.
