class ServiceLogsService:
    """Streams logs from the registered orchestrator(s) via the winter-defined contract.

    Single-provider (D1 short-circuit): invokes the sole orchestrator entrypoint as
    ``<entrypoint> logs <pattern...>`` with ``cwd`` at the workspace root. The
    ``<env>/<service>`` selection patterns are forwarded verbatim as positional argv
    tokens. Render parameters are conveyed via ``WINTER_LOG_*`` environment variables
    (``WINTER_LOG_FOLLOW``, ``WINTER_LOG_TAIL``, ``WINTER_LOG_SINCE``,
    ``WINTER_LOG_UNTIL``, ``WINTER_LOG_TIMESTAMPS``). Like every dispatch it also
    exports ``WINTER_WORKSPACE_DIR``, ``WINTER_EXT_DIR``, and ``WINTER_EXT_PREFIX``.
    The orchestrator's stdout is read as NDJSON; each line must carry an ``env`` field
    in addition to ``svc``/``msg``; winter applies a segment-aware backstop filter
    matching ``<env>/<svc>`` against the requested patterns, then applies time/tail
    filters and renders plain lines to stdout. The orchestrator's stderr inherits the
    parent's fd so diagnostics reach the terminal without corrupting the NDJSON stream.

    Multi-provider: builds the service ownership index via ``ServiceDescribeService``,
    determines which providers own the matched services, and routes each provider's
    ``logs`` action with only the patterns it owns. The output streams from each
    provider are merged through a shared ``LogStreamProcessor`` so the caller sees
    a single unified stream.

    Follow mode (D2): ``-f`` / ``follow=True`` is supported only when the matched
    services resolve to a **single** owning provider. When a follow request would
    span multiple owning providers, this method writes an actionable error to stderr
    and returns 1 without opening any stream.

    Returns the orchestrator's exit code (worst across providers), or 130 if
    interrupted by KeyboardInterrupt.
